Animedoro timer web-app build with Flask and JavaScript

### What is Animedoro?
The animedoro technique, invented by Josh Chen, is a perfect work time management for people who need more time to focus and for who love watching animes or shows.

It is based on the pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break, after 4 cycles there is a longer break. 

The animedoro changes this technique into 40 to 60 minutes of work and 20 minutes of watching an anime or a show (or other activities) of your choice. 

## Implementation
